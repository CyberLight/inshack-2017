Heeelp! I did a `rm` on my python file. All my work is gone! Would you help me restore it? <br>
I usually work with a <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">virtualenv</a> if this info can help you..
<code>ssh lost-file@lost-file.ctf.insecurity-insa.fr</code> (password lost-file)
