Caasi Vomisa built a bunker years ago because he already knew mankind was too dumb not to use nuclear warheads.
Today he is testing it again because he fears Pmurt or Nitup could push the wrong button on their coffee machines.

He was testing the bunker radio receiver when he received a strange transmission...

Can you help him find out what the transmission is about ?
