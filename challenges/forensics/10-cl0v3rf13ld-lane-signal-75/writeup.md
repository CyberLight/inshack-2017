# WriteUp - 10 Cl0v3rf13ld Lane Signal

If you start do dissect the unknown file you will quickly find that it is a concatenation of three files.

 + the first one is a jpeg cover a a famous film
 + the second one is png file illustrating morse code
 + and the third file is an OGG file which contains... guess what... A MORSE SIGNAL.

Just split the file in three files. Then listen to the OGG file and use the morse picture to decode it.

You'll get the flag.
