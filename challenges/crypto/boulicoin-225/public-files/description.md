# Challenge description:

I have installed a new app on my smartwatch to mine Boulicoins, the new trending cryptocurrency, but my watch isn't powerful enough.
Could you install the desktop client and mine me a coin or two ? I've also managed to get the server's source code if that can be of any help.
`python2 client.py boulicoin.insecurity-insa.fr`
