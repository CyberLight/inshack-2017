# Smart Sensors API

Caasi Vomisa bought a set of sensors and asked his friend, John, to build an API so that 
Caasi can aggregate the data coming from them using third party services. Yet John Doe is 
- sometimes - really stupid and he made two big mistakes...

Can you show Caasi that you are a brilliant Git user ?
