										In the adjacent picture you can see that with a simple curl request I could get classified information, the key is the user agent.

										You may think I should just change browser but it is too late already. For now I will just block all cookies, local storage and activate the "do not track function".

										I think they can spy me through my google account, I have checked about it so I am totally deconnected from youtube, gmail... For the smooth progress of my project I have to be connected to github, hoping it won't hurt me...

									<p class="flow-text">
										But it is not a problem for me anymore, I have found that you can fingerprint a browser and make it unique between millions. It remains the problem of different devices or the way to log in if I am not at home, I will figure out something later...
