# Solution

When we are connected we try some input and we see that only the destination 8.8.8.8 can received the flag and the application display our input. It's great!!

We have access to the source code and we know every variables names and the name of the flag variable

To display the variable allowed_flag we can put %(allowed_flag)s in the ip address input
