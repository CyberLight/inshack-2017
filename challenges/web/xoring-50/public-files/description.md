# Challenge description:

You decided to throw away the cheap connected lock you bought recently, in order to get a more secure one.
You bought a brand new - but not so cheap - connected lock. It has also a web interface that seems to be useless because you do not have any credentials. Of course, you don't want to make a mistake and decide to look for security vulnerability.

Find a way to get an access to the Admin section of the web interface: <a target="_blank" href="https://xoring.insecurity-insa.fr">https://xoring.insecurity-insa.fr</a>
